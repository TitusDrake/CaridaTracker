## Project Overview

**What is CaridaTracker?**
A mobile app for tracking volunteer costuming events ("troops") for multiple Star Wars costuming organizations. Users can belong to multiple clubs and get credit for attending troops under each club membership.

**Example:** John is a member of both Garrison Carida (501st) AND Kyber Base (Rebel Legion). He attends "Star Wars Day at Cades School" as both clubs → his stats show: 501st troops: 1, Rebel Legion troops: 1

## Database Schema (Current State)

### Tables

1. **users**
   - id, email, username, password_hash
   - first_name, last_name, phone_number, tkid (nullable)
   - is_super_admin (boolean)
   - created_at, updated_at

2. **organizations**
   - Parent organizations (501st Legion, Rebel Legion, Mandalorian Mercs, etc.)
   - id, name, description, created_at, updated_at

3. **clubs**
   - Local chapters within organizations
   - id, organization_id (FK), name, description, location, created_at, updated_at
   - Examples: Garrison Carida, Kyber Base, Mav Oya'la Clan

4. **club_members**
   - Users belong to clubs with roles
   - id, club_id (FK), user_id (FK), role, joined_at
   - **Roles:** super_admin, admin, member, cadet
   - UNIQUE(club_id, user_id) - user can only have one role per club
   - Users can belong to MULTIPLE clubs

5. **troops**
   - Event details (name, date, venue, address, times, amenities, etc.)
   - id, event_name, event_date, venue_name, address, city, state, zip_code
   - start_time, arrival_time, end_time
   - prop_weapons_allowed, share_with_sister_groups, secure_changing_area
   - changing_area_description, amenities, description
   - signup_link, policies_link
   - created_by (FK to users), created_by_club_id (FK to clubs)
   - created_at, updated_at

6. **troop_clubs**
   - Controls which clubs can see/access each troop
   - id, troop_id (FK), club_id (FK), enabled (boolean), created_at
   - UNIQUE(troop_id, club_id)
   - If a club isn't in this table for a troop, they can't see it

7. **troop_attendees**
   - User attendance records
   - id, troop_id (FK), user_id (FK), club_id (FK), status, notes, signed_up_at
   - **CRITICAL:** UNIQUE(troop_id, user_id, club_id)
   - Users can attend same troop multiple times (once per club)

8. **pgmigrations**
   - Tracks applied migrations (managed by node-pg-migrate)

---

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### How It Works
- **One shared database** for all clubs in a deployment
- **One deployment per geographic region** (e.g., PA, USA instance)
- You manage only YOUR clubs/instance
- Other regions deploy their own separate instances

### Organizations in PA Instance
- 501st Legion → Garrison Carida, Starkiller
- Rebel Legion → Kyber Base, Ghost Base
- Mandalorian Mercs → Mav Oya'la Clan
- Droid Builders → Mid Atlantic Droid and Prop Builders
- Jedi Sith Alliance → Central PA Jedi Sith Alliance

### Permission Structure
- **super_admin** - Can manage all clubs in deployment
- **admin** - Can manage specific club(s) they're assigned to
- **member** - Regular club member
- **cadet** - Limited access member

### Troop Visibility Example
1. Admin for Garrison Carida creates "Troop A"
2. Admin enables it for: Garrison Carida only (adds entry to `troop_clubs`)
3. Kyber Base members cannot see this troop in search
4. If enabled for both clubs, members from both can see and attend

### Multi-Club Attendance Example
- User "Jane" is member of Garrison Carida AND Kyber Base
- "Star Wars Day" troop is enabled for both clubs
- Jane signs up to attend as Garrison Carida member → troop_attendees entry (troop_id=1, user_id=5, club_id=1)
- Jane also signs up to attend as Kyber Base member → troop_attendees entry (troop_id=1, user_id=5, club_id=2)
- Jane's stats page shows: Garrison Carida troops: 1, Kyber Base troops: 1

## Development Environment

### Port Configuration
- **API Server:** 3000 (configurable in .env)
- **Expo DevTools:** 19000
- **Expo Metro Bundler:** 8081
- **PostgreSQL:** 5432

### Starting Development Servers

**Backend API (run in WSL):**
```bash
cd ~/Development/CaridaTracker-api
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Frontend Mobile App (run in Windows PowerShell):**
```bash
cd C:\Users\riche\Development\CaridaTracker
npm start
# Opens Expo DevTools
# Press 'a' for Android emulator
```

### Environment Variables (Backend .env)
```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=caridatracker
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/caridatracker

JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8081
```

### Frontend API Configuration
- **Development (Android Emulator):** `http://10.0.2.2:3000/api`
- **Development (iOS/Web):** `http://localhost:3000/api`
- **Production:** Configure in `services/api.ts`

## Key Decisions & Architecture

1. **Multi-tenancy approach:** One shared database per region, not per club
2. **Permissions:** Simple roles (super_admin, admin, member, cadet) scoped per club
3. **Troop visibility:** Controlled via `troop_clubs` junction table with enabled flag
4. **Multi-club attendance:** Users can attend same troop for multiple clubs, gets credit for each
5. **Migration tool:** node-pg-migrate for database changes (like Gradle)
6. **Stats tracking:** Per-club stats (not just global user stats)

## Important Notes

### Commits
- User handles all commits - AI should not attempt commits

### Database Migration Strategy
- NEVER modify existing migrations that have been applied
- Always create NEW migrations for schema changes
- Test migrations in dev before production
- Keep migrations small and focused

### Multi-Instance Deployment
- Each geographic region deploys their own instance
- Separate databases per region
- You manage PA instance only
- Other clubs can adopt and deploy their own
